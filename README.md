Artificial Neural Networks are simple yet powerful structures that can work well with multiple types of data,including image,sound,text...
In this project,I created an ANN with 3 hidden layers,each with 64 neuron.
The accuracy remained at %57,which indicates:
a)Insufficient Data
b)Incorrect Data
c)Problems with model architecture
d)The two variables are not really correlated
