Artificial Neural Networks are simple yet powerful structures that can work well with multiple types of data, including image, sound, text...  
In this project, I created an ANN with 3 hidden layers, each with 64 neurons.  
The accuracy remained at 57%, which indicates:  
- Insufficient Data  
- Incorrect Data  
- Problems with model architecture  
- The two variables are not really correlated
